# HyprlandSetup (Ml4w dotfiles)

(Sorry if copyright got violated, pls honor Ml4w and u/aayush-le on Reddit)

Keybinds are pretty similiar to Ml4w's, biggest changes are:

- Main Modifier key: Super (Windows) -> L/R Alt
- Open Rofi: L/R Alt + Space
- Switching focused window: L/R Alt + H (right)/L (left)/K (up)/J (down)
- Keyboard layout: de
- Removed some components from waybar

Everything else is pretty much the same, for example:

- **Installation steps:**
    - *first link on source*
- File Structure (and names)
- Scripts (Switching Wallpaper, Reloading waybar, ...)

and basically anything not included in "biggest changes"

(Except Wallpapers, might fix them later. Is only aesthetic issue anyway :3)

**This isn't fully finished, more like the bare start :)**
